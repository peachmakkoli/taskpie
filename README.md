# ðŸ¥§ TaskPie ðŸ¥§

TaskPie is a time management and task planning app for Android and iOS, intended to help users visualize how much of the day is devoted to different tasks and
better estimate how long a task will take via recording tools.

The first version of TaskPie was developed by Theo Moon (he/they), formerly known as Lee Higgins, using Flutter SDK and Firebase from July 6-24th, 2020 to satisfy his Capstone project for [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/), Cohort 13. This app is a work in progress with future enhancements planned. Check back later for updates!

## ðŸ¥§ Features

Current features are marked with a check, and planned features will be completed during 2020-2021 as time allows.
##### As a user...
- [x] I want to be able to log into the app using Google or email/password. **(MVP)**
- [x] I want my calendar to look like a circle representing a 24-hour clock, which is split into "pie slices," each representing a single task, so I can see all of the day's activities and what percentage of the day they take up. **(MVP)**
- [x] I want to be able to create and update tasks via a form. **(MVP)**
- [x] I want to be able to view task details by tapping on a pie slice, including buttons to edit or delete the event. **(MVP)**
- [x] I want to be able to assign categories to my tasks (e.g., sleeping, eating, socializing, etc.), so I can view how much of my day those categories take up (with color coding).
- [x] I want to be able to record how long it takes to complete a task, so I can better predict the time needed for that task in the future.
- [x] I want to be prompted by push notifications when a task is approaching and ending, so I can be reminded to record time.
- [ ] I want a stats page that shows me my daily average time spent in each category, given a date range.
- [ ] I want a settings button in the top bar that opens up a menu where I can see my name, a logout button, a button to access my task stats, and be able to switch between day and night mode.
- [ ] I want to be able to import my tasks from Google Calendar (or from a CSV file), so I do not have to recreate tasks I've already entered elsewhere. (Note: Overlapping tasks are not yet supported.)
- [ ] I want to be able to set a custom start and end hour for my calendar, so I can define the boundaries of my day (e.g., day starts when I wake up at 8am)
- [ ] I want to be able to share my calendar with friends by superimposing their pie chart over mine, so I can easily see where our free time aligns and plan tasks together.

## ðŸ¥§ Acknowledgements

This app would not be possible without the support of the following individuals and organizations: 

- [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/), a non-profit, tuition-free coding school for women and gender diverse adults, which focuses on serving low income people, underrepresented minorities, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.

- Cohort 13, the fiercest, most tenacious bunch of software developers I have ever known. We completed our capstone projects in just three weeks during a global pandemic, national protests for Black racial justice, and countless personal hurdles. Many of us had zero experience with coding prior to entering Ada Developers Academy. I am so proud of us and all that we have achieved!

- The Flutter Capstones Slack channel, a.k.a. #geniuslevelideas, who kept each other company with jokes, laughter, commiseration, and development support throughout the process.

- My roommate, friends with ADHD, and teachers at Ada Developers Academy, who inspired the idea for this app and helped me bring it to life.

- My family and friends who contributed to my crowdfund and made it possible for me to move to Seattle to attend Ada Developers Academy. 

- And [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com/), for providing this cute icon for the app logo!
